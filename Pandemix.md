# "Pandemix" 

A cooperative agent build for Pandemic board game.



- Implemented as a semester's assignment for ECE571 - Multiagent Systems@Technical University of Crete , ECE Dept.
- Interface built by Antonis Vogiatzis and Athina Georgara.
- Although a not highly sophisticated agent, the one implemented seems to acts fairly well (in terms of winning games) when combined with other agents (maximum 4).
- Project build as a result of a huge "duo" effort along with Angelos Kartakis.
